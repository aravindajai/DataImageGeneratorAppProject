The code implements a simple Tkinter application that generates an image from a user-entered text and displays it using the Pillow library (PIL).

Structure and Flow of the Code:
1. Tkinter GUI Application (User Interface)
The class DataImageGeneratorApp is defined to create a Tkinter window that prompts the user to input text and generates an image based on the input.

Attributes:

master: The main Tkinter window.
label: Displays a label prompting the user to enter the input.
entry: A text input field where users can enter their data.
generate_button: A button that, when clicked, triggers the image generation process.
Methods:

__init__(self, master): Initializes the Tkinter window with the label, input entry, and button.
generate_image(self): Fetches the user input from the entry box, defines the image size and font size, and calls generate_number_image() to create the image. If an invalid input is entered, an error message is shown.
2. Image Generation Logic
The function generate_number_image(text_entered, image_size=(400, 400), font_size=400) is responsible for creating an image based on the text entered by the user.

Steps in the function:
A blank image of size 400x400 with a white background is created using Pillow's Image.new() method.
The drawing context is initialized using ImageDraw.Draw().
The entered text is centered on the image using the text bounding box and draw.text() method.
The generated image is saved as a .png file (named Generated_Image_[input].png) and is displayed using the default image viewer.
3. Main Application Loop
The code ends with a main loop:

python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    root = tk.Tk()
    app = DataImageGeneratorApp(root)
    root.mainloop()

This creates the main window and starts the event loop of the Tkinter application.

Key Libraries:
Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface.
Pillow (PIL): For image creation and manipulation (specifically, creating a blank image and drawing text onto it).
Expected Output:
When the user enters text and clicks the Generate Image button:

An image with the text (centered on a white background) is generated.
The image is saved as a .png file in the working directory.
The image is automatically opened using the default image viewer.
Potential Issues:
The default font size (ImageFont.load_default()) does not support custom sizes as expected. The font_size parameter will not have an effect unless a custom font is loaded.
